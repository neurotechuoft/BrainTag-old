    - Question: shoudl we just let the developer use whatever they want?
      ie:
        ```

          post(samples):
            do_something()

          if __name__ == "main":

              neurostack = Neurostack(
                  device = devices.OpenBCI,
                  subscribers = [
                      post(samples),
                      
                  ]
              )

        ```
    - Answer: no; easier for dev to just use sockets
